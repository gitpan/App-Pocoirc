NAME
    App::Pocoirc - A command line tool for launching POE::Component::IRC
    clients

DESCRIPTION
    This distribution provides a generic way to launch IRC clients which use
    POE::Component::IRC. The main features are:

    *   Prints useful status information (to your terminal and/or a log
        file)

    *   Will daemonize if you so wish

    *   Supports a configuration file

    *   Offers a user friendly way to pass arguments to POE::Component::IRC

    *   Supports multiple IRC components and lets you specify which plugins
        to load locally (one object per component) or globally (single
        object)

    *   Has an interactive mode where you can issue issue commands and call
        methods on the IRC component(s).

        It can be used to launch IRC bots or proxies, loaded with plugins of
        your choice. It is very useful for testing and debugging
        POE::Component::IRC plugins as well as IRC servers.

CONFIGURATION
     nick:     foobar1234
     username: foobar
     log_file: /my/log.file
     lib:      /my/modules

     global_plugins:
       - [CTCP]

     local_plugins:
       - [BotTraffic]

     networks:
       freenode:
         server: irc.freenode.net
         local_plugins:
           - [AutoJoin, { Channels: ['#foodsfdsf'] } ]
       magnet:
         server: irc.perl.org
         nick:   hlagherf32fr

    The configuration file is in YAML or JSON format. It consists of a hash
    containing "global_plugins", "local_plugins", "networks", "lib",
    "log_file", "class", and default parameters to POE::Component::IRC. Only
    "networks" is required.

    "lib" is either the name of a directory containing Perl modules (e.g.
    plugins), or an array of such names. Kind of like Perl's *-I*.

    "log_file" is the path to a log file to which status messages will be
    written.

    "class" is the IRC component class. Defaults to
    POE::Component::IRC::State.

  Networks
    The "networks" option should be a hash of network hashes. The keys are
    the names of the networks. A network hash can contain "local_plugins"
    and parameters to POE::Component::IRC. None are required, except
    "server" if not defined at the top level. The POE::Component::IRC
    parameters specified in this hash will override the ones specified at
    the top level.

  Plugins
    The "global_plugins" and "local_plugins" options should consist of an
    array containing the short plugin class name (e.g. 'AutoJoin') and
    optionally a hash of arguments to that plugin. When figuring out the
    correct package name, App::Pocoirc will first try to load
    POE::Component::IRC::Plugin::*YourPlugin* before trying to load
    *YourPlugin*.

    The plugins in "global_plugins" will be instantiated once and then added
    to all IRC components. Note: not all plugins are designed to be used
    with multiple IRC components simultaneously.

    If you specify "local_plugins" at the top level, it will serve as a
    default list of local plugins, which can be overridden in a network
    hash.

OUTPUT
    Here is some example output from the program:
